This repository is a compilation of examples of Python scripts I wrote during my PhD, tidied up and displayed in Jupyter Notebooks. My area of research was tidal disruption events (TDEs), which occur when a start is torn apart by a black hole. As such the work shown here will mostly have a TDE-focus. 


Below is a short description of each script:

File: Emission_Line_Fit.ipynb
Description: In this notebook I create and fit models to emission lines in a TDE spectrum


File: SDSS_SQL_Query.ipynb
Description: An example of an SQL query using the SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) database to obtain information about galaxies in the local universe.


File: specplot.ipynb
Description: A short script to plot a spectrum with flux on the y-axis and wavelength on the x-axis


File: velocity_plot.ipynb
Description: In this script we plot emission lines on top of each other after converting wavelength to velocity, allowing us to directly compare the features of each line.
